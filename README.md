# Battleship
Battleship : The Classic Naval Combat Game

This is a python project.

HOW TO PLAY 

Place your 5 grey ships on your blue ocean grid, you can move the mouse across the grid to move the ship, and press down or right arrow key to change orientation. Click a cell on the grid when you're satisfied with the position. Then the next ship will similarly be ready for placement. Place all your ships in this way, to start playing.

Both players will decide between themselves, who goes first. 

If you're the one that goes first, then guess a position on your green screen grid ( eg : G 3 ). Your opponent will look at their own ocean grid to see if a ship lies at that position, or it's just ocean. They will then tell you if it is a hit or a miss, and they will left-click that position on their ocean grid.

Right click on your green screen grid at that position for hit, and left click for miss.

Now it's your opponent's turn. Similarly, they will guess a position, and you must tell them if it is a hit or a miss. and click that position on your ocean grid, while they mark a position on their screen grid.

If you hit all the cells of a ship, your opponent will tell you that you sank their ship.

There are 5 ships, with lengths 5, 4, 3, 3, 2.

If you guess a position and it's a hit, keep in mind the possible lengths of the ship, and which ships have already been sunk, before making your next guess.

HAVE FUN!
